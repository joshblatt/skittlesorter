# skittlesorter
This is the code used for my Skittle Sorter for my final project in MTE 100 and GENE 121.
There is one bug that we were not able to solve, when two Skittles are right beside each other without 
any black space (given by the conveyor belt) between them, it will not read the second Skittle.
Besides that, the code is functional. The efficiency could have been improved, but we were not able to
implement this due to time restraints.
